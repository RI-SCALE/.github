The RI-SCALE project develops scalable Data Exploitation Platforms (DEPs) that allow Research Infrastructures to extend their services with powerful computational environments and preconfigured AI applications. These platforms will help researchers and Research Infrastructures operators analyse, improve, and reuse complex datasets more effectively.

RI-SCALE has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101188168.
